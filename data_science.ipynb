The goal is to work through one sub section of each chapter per week. For example, the first chapter, Exploratory Data Analysis has a subsection:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Rectangular Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Which has further subsections\n",
        "- Data Frames and Indexes\n",
        "- Nonrectangular Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on how much effort is requried to complete the subsection we may break them down to one per week or try to get them all.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Meeting Times\n",

        "Hopefully we'll be able to meet up and discuss the chapters once a week. Currently we're looking at **Tuesdays at 6pm CST**. Here's a zoom link for the meeting: [here](https://zoom.us/j/97745088615) the meeting will also be recorded and posted so that it can be rewatched or used by people who could not make the meeting.\n",
